# ICO_Viability_Index
Analyzing various successful and unsuccessful ICOs for predictive success features.


# Class 2 - Pseudocode and status update
After initial weekend of research and data gathering, the team has worked out feasibility of project and agrees to a minimal viable product as described below.
1. Is a dashboard - single page that is accessible to general public or clients.
2. End user is a person not exactly super knowledgeable in cypto looking to get into investments in new coins, and needs guidance on what to look at more closely and what to absolutely avoid.  
3. Content of Dashboard - high level overview
    - Top is a highlight of viable ICOs/crypto products that are new to market that score highly in our scoring.
    - Middle is a highlight of new ICOs/crypto products that are new to market and score poorly, likely should be avoided.
    - Bottom *could* be coins in the past that we score, and a backtest to how we did (score versus how they ended up doing)
4. Defining a successful coin
    - Features that may be important that occur during ICO
        1. Git Commits
        2. Are you listed?
        3. Where are you listed?
        4. Target funding amount
        5. Marketing / lobbying intensity
        6. Sentiment analysis on:
            1. Public chatter (amount / intensity)
            2. News media
        7. Corporate governence
            1. Audited Financials?
            2. Board of Directors?
            3. Prior history of founders
            4. Credit rating?
    - Features to collect that track success after launch
        1. Was/is it listed? 
        2. Duration of listing
        3. What is the market cap and price trajectory/history?  Is current price greater or less than initial launch?
        4. Trading activity
        5. Sentiment analysis on:
            1. Public chatter (amount / intensity)
            2. News media

5. Minimal Viable Project - features that are attainable (we have less than two weeks to complete this project)
    - The team's work over the weekend determined the following are relatively easy to access and work with
        1. List of ICOs, incluing their funding round at launch... target funding is intermittant
        2. Current list of ICOs still trading, their market cap and volume
        3. Twitter data (API) with some limitations on history
        4. News feeds (API) with some limitations on volume
        5. Underlying hash algorithm that the ICO is built on

6. Creating the model .... *this needs to be pseudocoded*
    - Random forrest to help us determine features that are important?

7. Create the dashboard (marc to start working on this)
